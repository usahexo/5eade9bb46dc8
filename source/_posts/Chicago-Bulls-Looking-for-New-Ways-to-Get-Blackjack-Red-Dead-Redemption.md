#  Blackjack Red Dead Redemption Paying Dividends for Chicago Bulls
First it was Dwyane Wade, then Luol Deng. As the Chicago Bulls experienced in the past, key free agents often bolt for greener pastures come playoff time.
This off-season, they were determined not to let that happen again and thus, brought back Nikola Mirotic on a two-year deal and locked up Bobby Portis to a rookie-scale contract extension.
 
Then, on Halloween night, the Bulls pulled off a stunner by trading away their franchise player and centerpiece, Jimmy Butler, to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen.
While Butler is one of the best two-way players in the league and brings playoff experience to a young Timberwolves squad, the Bulls receive an equally impressive haul in return. LaVine is an athletic freak who averaged 18 points per game before tearing his ACL last February and Dunn is an uber-athletic point guard with upside who was drafted fifth overall last year. As for Markkanen, he was the seventh overall pick in this year’s draft and is one of the most versatile big men in recent memory due to his ability to shoot from deep.
 
Including Butler, the Bulls now have four players – Wade, Deng, Mirotic and Portis – who are 26 years old or younger who have already proven themselves at least somewhat in the NBA. With Fred Hoiberg entering his fourth season as head coach and a core of players who are familiar with his system, look for Chicago to be a dark horse team in the Eastern Conference next season.
