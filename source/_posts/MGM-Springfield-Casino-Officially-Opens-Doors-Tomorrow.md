#  MGM Springfield Casino Officially Opens Doors Tomorrow

After months of anticipation and speculation, the much-anticipated MGM Springfield Casino is set to open its doors tomorrow. The $960 million resort casino is the first of its kind in Massachusetts and is expected to create thousands of jobs in the area.

The casino opening has been met with mixed reactions in the local community. Some are excited about the new jobs and increased tourism, while others are concerned about potential negative impacts on traffic and crime.

MGM Springfield has been working hard to address these concerns. The company has pledged to invest $5 million in local community organizations and projects, and has also promised to hire from within the community whenever possible.

MGM Springfield features a 125,000-square-foot gaming floor with 3,000 slot machines and 144 gaming tables. There is also a spa, fitness center, poker room, and high limit salon. Dining options include seven restaurants, including several award-winning chefs. The hotel has 263 rooms and suites.

MGM Springfield, the $960 million dollar casino and resort in downtown Springfield, Massachusetts, officially opened on August 24, 2018. The massive complex includes a hotel, restaurants, a spa, and of course, a casino with more than 2,000 slot machines and 120 gaming tables.

The new MGM Springfield has been more than a decade in the making. In 2007, then-mayor Domenic Sarno proposed that a casino be built in the city to help spur economic development. In 2013, the city was chosen as one of three finalists for an eastern Massachusetts casino license. And in 2014, after a lengthy application process, MGM was chosen as the winner.

Groundbreaking on the project took place in August of 2015. The resort underwent extensive testing and construction over the next few years, including hiring of 1,500 employees and building of what is now the largest LED video display in North America.

Now that it's open, MGM Springfield is expected to generate more than $100 million in annual revenue and bring thousands of jobs to the region.
