#  NL West teams offer fresh opportunities to make money online gambling

The NL West is always an interesting division in Major League Baseball. This year, it looks like five of the six teams have a chance to make the playoffs. That means there’s good potential for some close races and big upsets.

No matter who wins the division, though, there are opportunities to make money by betting on NL West games online. So far this season, the Dodgers have been the best team in the division, but that could easily change over the course of the next few months.

The Padres have been playing surprisingly well so far this year, and they could be a good dark horse pick for anyone looking to make some money gambling on baseball games. The Rockies and Diamondbacks both look like they could be headed for another playoff run, while the Giants are starting to struggle a bit after a promising start to the season.

As always, the NL West is full of exciting baseball games with plenty of potential to make some money. Whether you’re rooting for your favorite team or looking to make some profits betting against them, there’s plenty of action in store in this division.

#  Dodgers, Diamondbacks offer biggest payouts in NL West gambling

The Dodgers and Diamondbacks offer the biggest payouts in the National League West if you are looking to gamble on a division winner. LA is at +240 while Arizona is at +275.

The Rockies offer the next best payout at +350, with the Giants and Padres both sitting at +650.

The Dodgers are coming off of a season in which they reached the World Series for the second year in a row. While they lost to the Red Sox, they are still considered one of the favorites to win it all in 2019.

The Diamondbacks, on the other hand, missed the playoffs last year and are looking to make a return this season. They made some big moves this offseason, most notably signing Zack Greinke.

The Rockies had a strong season last year and look poised to compete again this season. They added Ian Desmond this offseason and he should provide some value for them offensively.

The Giants had a terrible season last year but have made some big changes this offseason, most notably signing Andrew McCutchen. They are hoping that he will be able to help turn things around for them.

The Padres had a breakout season last year and look to build on that in 2019. Their lineup is young and talented, led by Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr.

#  Giants, Rockies provide good odds for betting on the NL West

The National League West is home to two of the best teams in baseball this season in the Colorado Rockies and San Francisco Giants. Oddsmakers have installed the Giants as Serie favorites at -150 and the Rockies at +125.

Both teams are off to strong starts, with the Giants leading the division at 22-11 and the Rockies just a game back at 21-12. The Giants have been led by their pitching, which ranks second in the majors with a 3.06 ERA. That staff will be put to the test in a tough road series against the Rockies this week.

The Rockies, meanwhile, have been getting great production from their offense, which ranks first in baseball in runs scored (274) and batting average (.286). Nolan Arenado has been on an incredible tear over the last month and leads all of baseball with 20 homers on the season.

Given these two teams’ form so far this season, it’s no surprise that they are among the favorites to win the NL West. However, there are some other good contenders in this division that should not be overlooked.

At +600, the Los Angeles Dodgers offer some good value as they continue to get healthier and closer to full strength. The Arizona Diamondbacks are also worth considering at +1500 given their strong start and potent lineup.

#  Padres a longshot in NL West gambling, but still worth betting on

There’s no denying that the Padres are the biggest underdog in the division this season, but they’re not without their appeal as a gambling option.

At +1800 to win the NL West, San Diego is a longshot, but there are still some reasons to believe in them. For one, they have quietly assembled some quality talent over the past few seasons. Fernando Tatis Jr., Manny Machado, Wil Myers, and Eric Hosmer form a formidable lineup that could surprise some teams this year.

The pitching staff is also better than people may think. Chris Paddack and Dinelson Lamet both flashed brilliance last year and could take another step forward in 2019. And if Robbie Erlin can return to pre-injury form, the Padres suddenly have one of the deepest pitching staffs in the division.

So while it’s certainly no sure thing, there are definitely reasons to bet on the Padres this season. At these odds, they could be worth a flyer for your betting portfolio.

#  NL West offers great chances to make money through online gambling

The NL West Division is a great place to make some money gambling this year. The Dodgers, Giants and Rockies all offer great opportunities to make some money. Let’s take a look at each team and see where the best opportunities lie.

Los Angeles Dodgers

When it comes to the Dodgers, there are a few different options for making money. The first is with their odds to win the World Series. At +650, they are one of the favorites to win it all. This means that if you bet $100 on them, you would win $650 if they were to win the championship.

You can also make money by betting on individual games. The Dodgers have odds of -155 against the Arizona Diamondbacks. This means that for every $100 you bet on them, you would win $155 if they win the game. There are also plenty of prop bets available for Dodgers games.

San Francisco Giants

The Giants offer similar opportunities as the Dodgers when it comes to gambling on their games. They have odds of -145 against the Padres and +120 against the Dodgers. There are also plenty of prop bets available for Giants games.

Colorado Rockies

The Rockies are risky, but offer some big payouts if you can hit them right. Their odds to win the World Series sit at +4000, meaning a $100 bet would return $4000 if they won it all. They also have odds of -185 against the Cubs and +165 against the Cardinals so there is potential for big wins in those matchups as well.
