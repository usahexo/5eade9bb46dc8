#  Trump Taj Mahal Closes Its Doors After 26 Years in Business

The Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey, announced that it would close its doors after 26 years in business. The casino is shutting down because of the high costs of unionized labor. According to the owner of the casino, Carl Icahn, the cost of unionized labor was simply too much and he could no longer operate the casino at a profit.

This announcement comes as a shock to many in the area, as the Trump Taj Mahal has been a staple in the community for more than two decades. The closure will leave nearly 3,000 people without jobs and will have a significant negative impact on the local economy.

The Trump Taj Mahal is not the only casino to close its doors in Atlantic City this year. In January, the Revel Casino shut down after just two years in operation. This leaves just eight casinos remaining in Atlantic City.

The closing of the Trump Taj Mahal is another sign of the struggles that Atlantic City is facing. The city has been battling competition from casinos in other states for many years now, and it seems to be taking its toll. In addition to the closures of the Revel Casino and Trump Taj Mahal, several other casinos have closed their doors in recent years.

It will be interesting to see if Atlantic City can rebound from this latest blow or if it is destined to become a ghost town when it comes to casinos.

#  Caesars Atlantic City Casino Files for Bankruptcy

The famed Caesars Atlantic City casino resort has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the second largest gambling hub in the US to do so this year.

The Chapter 11 filing will allow the casino to restructure its more than $1 billion in debt and keep its doors open. This is the latest blow for the struggling US gambling industry, which has been hit hard by competition from legal casinos in neighboring states.

Atlantic City's casinos have seen a dramatic decline in revenue in recent years, with total gaming win down more than 50% since 2006. The city was once home to 12 casinos, but now only has 8 remaining after several closures in recent years.

Caesars is reported to be in discussions with creditors about restructuring its debt, and plans to keep all of its properties open during the bankruptcy proceedings.

#  Trump's Bet365 Troubles Could Spell Trouble for Atlantic City

It was once thought that Trump's involvement in the casino industry would be a boon for Atlantic City, as he brought with him a name brand and considerable wealth. However, it now appears that Trump's business practices may have actually done more harm than good to the resort town.

Trump has been involved in a number of disputes with Bet365, one of the world's largest online gambling companies. The latest clash between the two companies came late last year, when Bet365 announced that it was pulling out of New Jersey due to Trump's threatening legal behavior.

Trump has accused Bet365 of being a "criminal enterprise" and of violating U.S. laws by taking bets from American customers. He has even threatened to sue the company if it doesn't pull out of New Jersey.

Bet365 isn't the only company to have had problems with Trump. In 2013, Trump sued Deutsche Bank AG and other lenders for $3 billion, accusing them of conspiring to tank his Atlantic City casinos. The case was eventually dismissed.

Trump'slegal troubles could spell trouble for Atlantic City as a whole. The resort town is already struggling financially, thanks in part to the closure of several casinos in recent years. If Trump's disputes with Bet365 continue, it's likely that more companies will pull out of Atlantic City, further damaging its economy.

#  Could the Failure of Trump Bet365 Spell the End of Atlantic City Casinos?

For a number of years, Atlantic City casinos have been hemorrhaging money, with Trump Taj Mahal being one of the most recent offenders. In July of this year, the casino closed its doors for good after declaring bankruptcy for the fourth time. This could be a sign of things to come for other Atlantic City casinos, as their main customer base is waning.

The roots of the problem can be traced back to 2006 when New Jersey passed legislation that allowed Atlantic City casinos to offer table games, such as blackjack and roulette. This drew business away from neighboring states, like Pennsylvania and Delaware, which had previously held a monopoly on casino gambling. The novelty of playing table games in an East Coast resort town soon wore off, and customers began to dwindle.

In an attempt to revive their fortunes, Atlantic City casinos began offering slot machines in 2010. But this only served to exacerbate the problem, as people preferred to gamble on slots rather than at tables. The revenue generated by slots is much lower than that generated by table games.

To make matters worse, competition from new casinos in neighboring states has intensified in recent years. For example, Philadelphia now has six casinos within easy driving distance of Atlantic City. This has caused many gamblers to flock to those venues instead.

The result has been a dramatic decline in revenue for Atlantic City casinos. In 2006, they took in $5 billion worth of bets; by 2015 that figure had shrunk to just $2.5 billion. This has led many of them to declare bankruptcy and/or close down operations.

The Trump Taj Mahal is only the latest casualty in this downward spiral. It will be interesting to see if other casinos follow suit or manage to find a way to stem the tide.

#  What Happens to Atlantic City if the Trump Bet365 Fails?

Atlantic City, NJ was once a popular tourist destination and gaming mecca. But the city has seen better days. The popularity of casinos in other states combined with a series of natural and man-made disasters has taken its toll on the city. While there is no one definitive answer to the question of what happens to Atlantic City if the Trump Bet365 fails, here are some possible scenarios.

The first possibility is that the city would go into bankruptcy. This would likely mean that all of the casinos in the city would close, throwing thousands of people out of work. The city government would also likely be forced to make significant cuts to essential services.

Another possibility is that the state government would step in and take control of the city. This could lead to a variety of outcomes, including casino closures, reductions in services, or even a sale of the city to another party.

A third possibility is that Atlantic City would become a ghost town. Without any tourists or casino revenue, many businesses would close down and the population would dwindle. This could lead to increased crime rates and a general decline in quality of life for residents.
