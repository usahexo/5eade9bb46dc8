`Angry Birds` is a new puzzle game for the iPhone and iPod Touch. The premise of the game is to use a slingshot to launch birds at structures inhabited by green pigs in an attempt to knock them down. The game has 96 levels which are grouped into four worlds: Grasslands, Beach, Snow, and Air.

What makes this game so addictive is that you are constantly trying to get one more higher score. You can also share your high scores with your friends online. The controls are simple and easy to use. You just drag your finger on the screen to set up the angle and power of your shot, then release your finger to launch the bird.

There are many different types of birds available in the game, each with their own unique abilities. For example, some birds are able to explode and take out several pigs at once, while others can bounce off walls or objects. You can also earn points by hitting gold or silver coins that are hidden in some of the levels.

The graphics and animations in `Angry Birds` are top-notch. The physics engine is also very realistic, making it a lot of fun to play. There is even a catchy theme song that will have you humming along in no time!
