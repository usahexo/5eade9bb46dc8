According to The Economist, in 2015 global online gambling revenues totaled $37.91 billion. This number is only projected to grow in the future as internet usage becomes more widespread. And though there are many benefits to gambling online—convenience, anonymity, and a bigger selection of games than at traditional casinos—gambling can also be addictive and damaging to your finances and your relationships. So how can you enjoy online gambling without letting it get out of hand?</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for keeping your wagers in check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a budget and stick to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you start gambling, decide how much money you’re willing to lose and don’t exceed that amount. You may also want to have a “stop loss” limit, which is the maximum amount you’re willing to lose in one day or one session. If you hit your stop loss, stop playing immediately.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Only gamble with money you can afford to lose.</li>
</ol>
<p>This rule goes hand in hand with the first one. Don’t gamble with money you need for rent, bills, or other expenses. If you do, you’ll only be setting yourself up for financial trouble if you lose it all.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Keep track of your spending.</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be easy to lose track of how much money you’re spending while gambling online, especially if you’re playing multiple games simultaneously or playing over a long period of time. Keep a record of how much money goes in and out of your account each day (or week) so you have a better idea of how much cash you have available to gamble with.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Quit while you’re ahead.</li>
</ol>
<p>The saying “quit while you’re ahead” applies doubly when it comes to gambling online: not only should you quit while you’re up, but also make sure that the amount of money in your account is more than what you started with so you don’t end up losing money overall. This can be easier said than done, but it’s worth trying to stick to so you don’t go overboard with your wagers.<br>5 Play low-risk games .</p>

<h1 id="Ways-to-Help-You-Resist-Gambling-at-an-Internet-Casino"><a href="#Ways-to-Help-You-Resist-Gambling-at-an-Internet-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Help You Resist Gambling at an Internet Casino"></a>Ways to Help You Resist Gambling at an Internet Casino</h1><p>Gambling can be addictive, and for some people, it can be hard to resist the temptation of spending money on games of chance at an online casino. If you want to prevent yourself from gambling at an internet casino, here are a few things that might help:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a commitment to yourself that you will not gamble online.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you make a clear commitment to yourself, it’s easier to stick to it. Tell your friends and family about your decision, and ask them to support you in your effort. Putting your goals out there for others to see will also help keep you accountable.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Delete the casino’s app from your phone or computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>If having the app on your device is too tempting, delete it altogether. This way, you’ll have to go out of your way if you want to gamble, and that may be enough of a deterrent for some people.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Avoid websites and forums related to gambling.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re constantly exposed to temptation, it will be that much harder to resist. Stay away from websites and forums where people talk about gambling and share tips on how to win big. These places are not good for someone who’s trying to stay away from casinos.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Sign up for a self-exclusion program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some online casinos offer self-exclusion programs, which allow you to voluntarily ban yourself from gambling on their site for a certain period of time. This is a great option if you feel like you can’t control yourself around online casinos.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Keep track of how much money you’re spending on gambling activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to keep yourself honest is by tracking how much money you’re spending on gambling-related activities each month (or week). This can help put into perspective just how much money you’re really losing—and might motivate you to cut back or stop altogether.</p>

If you’re someone who struggles with gambling problems, it can be important to take steps to avoid them when playing at online casinos. Here are a few tips for doing just that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose. This is one of the most important things to remember when gambling, whether online or in person. Don’t gamble with money that you rely on for bills or other expenses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set strict limits on how much money you’re willing to spend each day or week on gambling. It’s easy to get carried away and lose more money than intended if you’re not careful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t chase your losses. If you find yourself losing money faster than you can afford to, stop gambling and walk away from the casino site altogether. There’s no shame in admitting defeat and walking away a winner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay aware of the signs that you may be developing a gambling problem. These can include spending more time gambling than intended, feeling anxious or depressed when unable to gamble, or lying about how much money has been lost or won while gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek help if you feel like you can’t control your gambling habit. There are many resources available for people struggling with gambling problems, including counseling and support groups. Don’t try to tackle this problem on your own – get help from professionals who understand addiction and rehabilitation therapies.</p>
</li>
</ol>

Do you keep telling yourself that this is the time you’re going to quit, but then find yourself gambling away your hard-earned money anyway? Don’t worry – you’re not alone. Many people struggle with the temptation to gamble, but there are a few things you can do to help keep yourself in check.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a budget and stick to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important thing is to set a budget and stick to it. Decide how much money you’re willing to spend on gambling each day, week, or month, and don’t go over that amount. If you find yourself getting close to your limit, walk away from the casino until the next day or week.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use self-control techniques.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find it difficult to stick to your budget, try using self-control techniques such as counting down from 10 or taking deep breaths. If possible, remove all sources of temptation from your environment – for example, by closing your internet browser or deleting the casino’s app from your phone.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stay busy.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re not gambling, stay busy! This will help take your mind off of gambling and make it less likely that you’ll give in to temptation. Catch up on your reading, watch a movie, or go for a walk – anything that will keep you distracted.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Seek help if necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find that you can’t resist the urge to gamble and are struggling to control your behaviour, it may be helpful to seek professional help. There are many organisations and support groups available that can provide counselling and guidance on how to overcome a gambling addiction.</p>
