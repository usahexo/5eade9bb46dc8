This guide will teach you the basics of playing casino dice sport so you can enjoy this fun and exciting game.</p>
<p>To play casino dice sport, you will need a set of casino dice, some chips or coins to bet with, and a table to play on. The aim of the game is to score as close to 21 as possible using the five dice. You can score points by rolling the dice two, three, four, or five at a time. If you roll doubles (two of the same number), then you score twice the points shown on the dice. If you roll triples (three of the same number), then you score three times the points shown on the dice. If you roll four of the same number, then you score four times the points shown on the dice. If you roll five of the same number, then you score five times the points shown on the dice.</p>
<p>To start playing casino dice sport, each player must place a bet. The player with the lowest chip or coin value starts first and rolls one die. The player with the highest chip or coin value starts second and rolls two dice. If both players have equal chip or coin values, then they both roll one die each to see who goes first. The player who rolls higher goes first. The player who goes first starts by rolling all five dice and choosing any combination of two to keep. For example, if they roll a two and a four, they could keep the two and discard the four, or keep the four and discard the two. If they roll doubles (two of the same number), then they automatically keep all five dice as they have scored double the points shown on them. Once the player has chosen which two to keep, they set them aside and roll three new dice. They then choose another combination of two from these three new dice to keep, setting them aside and rolling again until they have used all five new dice. At this point, they total up all their points (the points shown on all seven dice) and compare it to their bet amount to see if they have won or lost money.</p>
<p>The player going second starts by rolling one die and setting it aside. They then roll three new dies and choose any combination of two to keep for their first turn. They follow exactly the same process as described above for their second turn (rolling one die, setting it aside; rolling three new dies; choosing any combination of two). They continue doing this until they have used all five new dies for their turn. At this point, they total up all their points (the points shown on all six dice) and compare it to their bet amount to see if they have won or lost money.</p>
<p>If both players end up with zero points after their final turns (for example, if both players rolled low numbers throughout), then neither player wins nor loses money and it is considered a draw. However, if either player has more than zero points after their final turn (for example, if one player had rolled high numbers throughout), then that player would be considered as having won money over their opponent(s). The amount won would be equivalent to whatever chips or coins were wagered by each player at the beginning of the game minus any losses incurred by either player during gameplay i</p>

In this game, players will attempt to roll a combination of three numbers that match the combinations shown on the payout table. The payout table will vary depending on the casino you are playing at, but typically includes winning combinations such as a triple (three of the same number), a six-way (six different numbers), straight (all six numbers in order), and so on.</p>
<p>In order to start playing casino dice sport, you will first need to place a bet. This can be done by placing chips in the betting area on the table or by stating how much you would like to wager before the dice are rolled. Once the bet is placed, one or two players will roll the dice and attempt to create a winning combination. If there is no winner after both players have rolled their set of dice, then additional rolls may be asked for until either a player wins or all bets are lost.</p>

<p>Dice Sport Overview</p>
<p>Dice Sport is a game that simulates a battle between two opponents using six-sided dice. The game is usually played for money but can also be played for fun. The objective of the game is to score more points than your opponent by rolling the dice and achieving different combinations. Each player begins the game with 1000 points which are reduced as they are lost through bets or when dice are used to score points. The first player to lose all their points automatically loses the game.</p>
<p>The game proceeds in rounds with each player taking turns to roll the dice. At the beginning of each round, each player selects one die to keep while discarding the other four. The player then rolls the die they have chosen and attempts to score points by achieving certain combinations as shown on the scoring chart below:</p>
