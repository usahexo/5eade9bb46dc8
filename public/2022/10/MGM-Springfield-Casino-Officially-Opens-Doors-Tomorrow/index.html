<p>The casino opening has been met with mixed reactions in the local community. Some are excited about the new jobs and increased tourism, while others are concerned about potential negative impacts on traffic and crime.</p>
<p>MGM Springfield has been working hard to address these concerns. The company has pledged to invest $5 million in local community organizations and projects, and has also promised to hire from within the community whenever possible.</p>
<p>MGM Springfield features a 125,000-square-foot gaming floor with 3,000 slot machines and 144 gaming tables. There is also a spa, fitness center, poker room, and high limit salon.

<p>Now that it’s open, MGM Springfield is expected to generate more than $100 million in annual revenue and bring thousands of jobs to the region.</p>
