      Supreme Court Strikes Down Federal Ban On Sports Betting

<p>In a 6-3 decision, the justices ruled that the law, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or Paspa, unconstitutionally interfered with states’ rights to make their own decisions about whether to allow gambling within their borders.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the majority, said that the law was “inconsistent with the fundamental principles of federalism.”</p>
<p>The ruling is a defeat for the National Football League and other professional sports leagues, which had argued that Paspa was necessary to protect the integrity of their games. It also opens up a potentially lucrative new market for casinos and other gambling businesses.</p>
<p>The decision comes at a time when many states are weighing whether to expand their gambling offerings, including in ways that would allow people to bet on sports over the internet. New Jersey, which brought the case before the Supreme Court, has been eager to legalize sports betting and reap its potential tax revenue.</p>
<p>Monday’s ruling applied only to New Jersey and three other states — Delaware, Montana and Oregon — that had already allowed some limited forms of sports betting before Paspa was enacted in 1992. But it could pave the way for legal sports betting nationwide.</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a dissenting opinion that she would have upheld Paspa because it “does not contravene any constitutional protection.” She was joined by Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Sportsbooks-Brace-For-Massive-Influx-Of-Bettors"><a href="#Nevada-Sportsbooks-Brace-For-Massive-Influx-Of-Bettors" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Sportsbooks Brace For Massive Influx Of Bettors"></a>Nevada Sportsbooks Brace For Massive Influx Of Bettors</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board announced Tuesday that it has given the state’s sportsbooks clearance to begin taking bets on the NFL season. This move is expected to lead to a massive influx of bettors, with some sportsbooks estimating that they could take as much as $50 million in bets over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>This is great news for the state’s casinos, which have been struggling in recent years due to the legalization of gambling in other states. The influx of new bettors is also likely to generate significant tax revenue for Nevada.</p>
<p>Nevada sportsbooks have been taking bets on NFL games since 1949, but this is the first time that they have been able to accept bets on the preseason. In order to place a bet, players must be at least 21 years old and must present a valid ID.</p>
<p>Nevada has long been known as the king of gambling, and its sportsbooks are some of the most popular in the world. In fact, the state’s casinos took in more than $250 million worth of bets on last year’s Super Bowl alone.</p>
<p>With college football now underway and the NFL season just around the corner, sports betting is once again becoming a hot topic nationwide. For those who are unfamiliar with how it works, here is a quick breakdown:</p>
<p>When betting on football, there are two basic types of wagers – point spreads and totals. A point spread is basically a handicap that is given to one team by the bookie. This number tells you how many points they must win by or lose by in order for you to win your bet. A total is simply the combined score of both teams at the end of the game.</p>
<p>There are also a number of different betting options available within each category. For example, you can bet on which team will cover the spread, which team will win straight up, or how many points will be scored in total. You can also place parlays and prop bets, which involve betting on multiple games or outcomes simultaneously.</p>
<p>If you are new to sports betting, it is important to learn as much as possible about how it works before placing any wagers. There are plenty of resources available online, including websites like Sports Betting Dime and Odds Shark. These sites provide detailed information on all aspects of sports betting, from beginner guides to advanced strategy articles.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Prepares-To-Begin-Taking-Bets-On-Sports"><a href="#New-Jersey-Prepares-To-Begin-Taking-Bets-On-Sports" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Prepares To Begin Taking Bets On Sports"></a>New Jersey Prepares To Begin Taking Bets On Sports</h1><p>New Jersey is moving closer to taking sports bets, as lawmakers approved a bill on Monday that would allow casinos and racetracks to start accepting wagers. The Assembly passed the legislation by a vote of 48-27, sending it to the desk of Gov. Phil Murphy, who is expected to sign it into law.</p>
<p>Once Murphy does so, New Jersey will become the third state after Nevada and Delaware to offer legal sports betting. The Garden State has been laying the groundwork for this day for years, with Murphy himself saying during his campaign that he would “work to legalize sports betting in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>Murphy has not indicated whether he plans to sign the bill before or after the Super Bowl, which will be played on Feb. 3 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. But there is no doubt that New Jersey will be ready to start accepting bets once the governor gives his approval.</p>
<p>“It’s an exciting day,” said Democratic Assemblyman Ralph Caputo of Newark. “We’re finally legalizing sports betting, which is something we should have done a long time ago.”</p>
<p>Under the bill, casinos and racetracks would be able to offer both in-person and online sports betting. They would also be able to offer wagers on collegiate and professional sporting events, although bets on high school sports would be prohibited.</p>
<p>The state Division of Gaming Enforcement would be responsible for regulating sports betting, and operators would be required to pay an 8 percent tax on their gross gaming revenue from such activities. That rate is lower than the 12 percent tax currently imposed on casino gambling revenue in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Proponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will generate new revenue for the state, while opponents contend that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. But there appears to be broad support for the measure among New Jersey lawmakers, as well as within the state’s gaming industry.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Accounts-For-Nearly-150-Billion-Annually"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Accounts-For-Nearly-150-Billion-Annually" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Accounts For Nearly $150 Billion Annually"></a>Sports Betting Accounts For Nearly $150 Billion Annually</h1><p>A new study has found that sports betting is a $148 billion industry, with over two thirds of that amount wagered illegally.</p>
<p>The research, conducted by Student Loan Hero, also found that the average American adult gambles nearly $1,300 a year on sports.</p>
<p>“This research shows that sports betting is a massive industry that impacts almost every American adult,” said Elyssa Kirkham,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> lead researcher for the study. “With such high stakes, it’s important for people to understand the risks and rewards involved before wagering their hard-earned money.”</p>
<p>The study also looked at how people gamble on sports. It found that 45% of gamblers use some form of illegal bookmaking operation, while only 15% use legal channels such as Nevada casinos or offshore websites.</p>
<p>The remaining 40% of gamblers use informal means such as family or friends to place bets. This type of betting often carries more risk because there is no regulatory body overseeing the bet.</p>
<p>Despite the risks, the study found that most gamblers are not deterred from betting on sports. In fact, 82% of those surveyed said they plan to continue gambling in some form this year.</p>
<p>So why do people gamble on sports? According to the study, the top reasons are excitement (76%) and the chance to win money (73%).</p>
<p>Other reasons given include enjoying watching games with friends (41%), following teams or players they like (38%), and filling time (27%).</p>
<p>Clearly, there are many reasons why people gamble on sports. And while some may be successful in winning money, others could find themselves out of luck – and in debt.</p>
<p>Sports gambling has become a huge industry in America, with almost $150 billion being wagered each year. The average American adult gambles nearly $1,300 annually on various sporting events. Most gamblers don’t seem to be discouraged by the risks involved; 82% say they will continue gambling this year.</p>
<h1 id="Players-In-The-United-States-Can-Now-Legally-Bet-On-Sports"><a href="#Players-In-The-United-States-Can-Now-Legally-Bet-On-Sports" class="headerlink" title="Players In The United States Can Now Legally Bet On Sports"></a>Players In The United States Can Now Legally Bet On Sports</h1><p>A bill legalizing sports betting in the United States was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Monday, May 14. The bill, called the “Sports Wagering Act of 2018” allows states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association (AGA), a trade group representing the casino industry, has been lobbying for the legalization of sports betting for years. The AGA estimates that Americans illegally bet $150 billion on sports each year.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear how each state will implement the new law, but there are many potential opportunities for casinos and other gaming operators to offer sports betting products. Some states may decide to limit sports betting to casinos and racetracks, while others may allow it through mobile apps or websites.</p>
<p>The NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL all opposed the legalization of sports betting, but have since softened their stance. The NFL now says that it will work with Congress and the gaming industry “to ensure that regulation protects the integrity of our sport.”</p>
<p>The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) prohibited sports betting in all states except Nevada. PASPA was struck down by the Supreme Court in May 2018 in a landmark decision known as Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association.</p>
